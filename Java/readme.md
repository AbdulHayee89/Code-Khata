## History of Java programming language
* The history of Java is very fascinating.
* James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
* Gosling designed Java with a C/C++ style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
* Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
* The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. 
* Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.
* Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.
* Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.
* It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.


## Java Versions
* From the first version released in 1996 to the latest version 19 released in Sept 2022, the Java platform has been actively being developed for about nearly 27 years. Many changes and improvements have been made to the technology over the years.

1. JDK Beta (1995)
2. JDK 1.0 (23rd Jan 1996)
3. JDK 1.1 (19th Feb 1997)
4. J2SE 1.2 (8th Dec 1998)
5. J2SE 1.3 (8th May 2000)
6. J2SE 1.4 (6th Feb 2002)
7. J2SE 5.0 (30th Sep 2004)
8. Java SE 6 (11th Dec 2006)

### From the above mentioned versions we can see that the naming and the version number have been changing over times:-

* Versions 1.0 and 1.1 are named as JDK (Java Development Kit).
* From versions 1.2 to 1.4, the platform is named as J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition).
* From versions 1.5, Sun introduces internal and external versions. Internal version is continuous from previous ones (1.5 after 1.4), but the external version has a big jump (5.0 for 1.5). 
* This could make confusion for someone, so keep in mind that version 1.5 and version 5.0 are just two different version names for only one thing.
* From Java 6, the version name is Java SE X.
* Major versions were released after every 2 years, however the Java SE 7 took 5 years to be available after its predecessor Java SE 6, and 3 years for Java SE 8 to be available to public afterward.
* Since Java SE 10,  new versions will be released very six months.
